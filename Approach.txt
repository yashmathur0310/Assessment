Performed eda on the training dataset to find the correlation between SalePrice and other columns
Understood the distribution of various columns ( numerical and categorically)
Found the count distribution of each categorical columns
Found the mean,median and mode of each numerical columns

For Machine Learning--- 
Dropped the columns which were having more than 40 percent null values
label encoded the categorical columns 
implemented linear regression , xgboost ,random forest 
calcaluate the metrics to find the best performing algorithm 
Predicted the price on testing dataset using the best algorithm
the final submisssion is containing the predicted prices with id
